0. About

Bouncing Ball is software for comparing the dynamics of music and movement as described in Sievers, B., Polansky, L., Casey, M., & Wheatley, T. (2013). Music and movement share a dynamic structure that supports universal expressions of emotion. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(1), 70-75.


1. Dependencies

Bouncing Ball requires Max/MSP, available for purchase from Cycling '74 (it is not currently fully functional with the Max Runtime because of the need to switch in and out of presentation mode):

http://cycling74.com/products/max/

Bouncing Ball requires the OpenSoundControl external object for Max/MSP, available in CNMAT's collection of Max/MSP/Jitter externals downloadable at the following URL:

http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads

The animated component of Bouncing Ball requires Processing, open source software available for download at the following URL:

http://processing.org/

Bouncing Ball requires additional open source libraries for Processing, listed here with download locations:

OCD: Obsessive Camera Direction:
	http://gdsstudios.com/processing/libraries/ocd/

oscP5:
	http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscp5/


2. Instructions

After installing the required dependencies, open up the Processing sketch "bouncing_ball/bouncing_ball.pde" and run it.

Open up the Max patch "bouncing_ball.maxpat".

Comments within the Max patch describe how to set the participant ID, change the on screen slider labels, randomize the slider labels, randomize the hardware controller functions, and so on.

Placing the patch into presentation mode and pressing the "Start" button will show controls for the experiment described in Sievers, B. et al. (2013).
